## 🔌 API Integration

### Current Status

The implementation uses **MOCK DATA** when `VITE_MOCK=1` is set in `.env.local`. The app will work perfectly with mock data for local development and testing.

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/
  features/
    customer/
      api.js                 # NEW - Customer profile API functions
      routes.jsx            # Existing routes file
  pages/

      Profile.jsx           # ENHANCED - Full profile implementation

## 🎨 UI Components Used

The implementation uses existing shared UI components:

- `Card` - For section containers
- `Button` - For actions
- `Input` - For form fields
- `Label` - For form labels
- `Tabs` - For organizing sections
- `Badge` - For status indicators

## 🔧 Testing with Real API

### Current Status (as of Nov 20, 2025):

| Feature | Backend Status | Works with Real API? |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| View/Edit Profile | ✅ Implemented | ✅ YES - use `VITE_MOCK=0` |
| Visit History | ✅ Implemented | ✅ YES - use `VITE_MOCK=0` |
| User Preferences | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ NO - uses mock data |
| Loyalty Points | ❌ Not implemented | ❌ NO - uses mock data |

### To Test with Real API:

1. **For Profile & Appointments** (ready to test):
   ```bash
   # In .env.local
   VITE_MOCK=0
   VITE_API=https://cs490-groupproject-backend-production.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **For Preferences & Loyalty** (wait for backend):
   - These features will show mock data until backend implements:
     - `/api/auth/preferences` (GET/PUT)
     - `/api/loyalty/points` (GET)

3. **Test profile operations:**
   - ✅ Load profile data from `/api/auth/me`
   - ✅ Update profile information via `/api/auth/profile`
   - ✅ View appointment history from `/api/appointments/`
   - 🟡 Preferences (mock only for now)
   - 🟡 Loyalty points (mock only for now)

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production, test the following scenarios:

1. **Profile Management**
   - Load profile on first visit
   - Edit and save profile information
   - Cancel editing (should revert changes)
   - Update address fields
   - Handle validation errors from backend

2. **Preferences**
   - Load preferences on first visit
   - Toggle favorite services
   - Update communication settings
   - Update reminder preferences
   - Save and verify persistence

3. **Visit History**
   - Display past appointments correctly
   - Show appointment details (service, provider, date)
   - Display payment status
   - Show cancellation reasons when applicable

4. **Loyalty Points**
   - Display points per salon
   - Show recent activity
   - Handle empty state (no points yet)

5. **Error Handling**
   - Network errors
   - Invalid data
   - Missing fields
   - Unauthorized access

## 🚀 Local Development

To test with mock data:

1. Ensure `.env.local` contains:
   ```
   VITE_MOCK=1
   VITE_AUTH_MODE=stub
   VITE_API=http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Log in as a customer (use demo button or go to `/auth/sign-in?demo=customer`)

4. Navigate to `/customer/profile`

5. Test all features with mock data

## 📝 Notes for Backend Team

- All endpoints should require authentication (Bearer token)
- Profile updates should validate all fields server-side
- Date of birth should be in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Phone numbers can be in any format (formatting done on frontend)
- Email should be validated server-side
- Consider adding profile image upload support in the future
- Preferences should have sensible defaults if not set
- Consider rate limiting on profile update endpoints

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Profile image upload and management
2. Password change functionality
3. Two-factor authentication settings
4. Connected social accounts
5. Download personal data (GDPR compliance)
6. Account deletion option
7. Notification history
8. Preferred payment methods management
